hi, this is my first file to this series. read the **readme** if you dont have a clue abt what this is lol.
anyway, lets start

-character

character is the most important part of you. you are your character and your character defines you. it's weird. both rely on each other and need to learn to cope in order
to build who you are or you're going to be stuck inbetween your mind and your body.

the only reason i start with character is because a lot of people are scared to play with their main character, and it makes up a ton about your actions and such,
some people like me tuck their fantasy character away into their heads and only use a bit of what they actually want to be. i'm no different and i've learned
it can be kind of a weird thought through it, but really, you're lucky if your head can connect to your body naturally.

character depends on a ton of things though, like for me, i can't be who i want to be with the situations im in. im a mind and a body, not fused into one being. 
the problem that gets me thinking isn't why we don't be who we are because usually we can't control it otherwise we would have already been the person in our dreams.
but the problem is when other people get to tell you who you are.

you're you, that's what matters.
that's home.

your friends can tell you that you're something else, that you're this innocent person, that you're a fan of something or whatever it may be. but they'll 
never know you like your mind does. your mind knows you best, and if it knows it's something better, something different, then that's who you are, 
not what society tells you you are. so just remember that, remember that you're in control of yourself. yeah, maybe it will take some time to learn how to work 
together with your body and mind to become one, but while you're in that process, don't let others get into your head and forge their own character out of you.

you're your own main character, so create your own journey too.
